#  Player Re-Identification in Sports Footage

**Assignment for AI Intern Role at Liat.ai**  
This project implements a robust **Player Re-Identification System** using computer vision and deep learning. It supports both single-camera tracking and cross-camera player mapping in sports video footage.

##  Project Overview

Player Re-ID ensures that the same player retains a consistent ID:
-  Even after **temporarily going out of view**
-  Across **different camera angles**

###  Task Options Implemented
1. **Single-Camera Re-Identification**:  
   Detect and track players across time in a single video, re-assigning consistent IDs after players reappear.

2. **Cross-Camera Player Mapping**:  
   Match players from one camera (e.g., `broadcast.mp4`) to another (e.g., `tacticam.mp4`) with consistent ID mapping.
